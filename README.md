# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose & Overview
The purpose of this project was use the Leaflet.js and create a geographical map using GeoJSON earthquake data from USGS (provided by a URL). Each data point (earthquake) would then be visually represented on a map by a circle and color, which change based on each earthquake's magnitude. Further, each earthquake would have a popup dialogue box describing the location and details of the event.

## Results
A map with a layer selection and an earthquake magnitude legend:
